+ a giant has 140 life points and 5 strength points
+  a dwarf has 60 life points and 20 strength points
+ a wizard has 80 life points and 10 strength points




once set up is done, a player choose to fight a member of the other team or to heal a member of his team.

+ a player choose to fight :  he'll be promped to choose a fighter (he can't fight with a wizard) and an opponent (wizards included). the strength points of the fighter is subtracted from the life points of the opponent.
+ a player choose to heal : he'll be prompted to choose a fighter to cure. the strength points of the wizard is added to the life points of the chosen fighter. the wizard can't cure himself.



from time to time, a special gift pops up. it doubles the fighter or the wizard strength points during the round.

the game ends and a winner is declared when there are no life points left in a team.
